Here is the simple project of the Buggy NFT. It contains a lot of bugs, some of them are critical, some of them have lower severity. 

The task here is to find as many bugs as possible.

In the zip file (please download the Zip file) you will see the forge project with the vulnerable code. You have 4h to complete this assignment.

We expect either a .txt /.md file with listing of all the bugs you can find in the format of:

Line number
What is the bug?
How can someone exploit this?

Or the inline comment inside the code. The comment should start with // @immunefi <description of the bug> <how can someone exploit this?>

The code should be zipped and sent back to the interviewer

Explanations donâ€™t need to be very lengthy, only on point. For example // @immunefi re-entrancy attack due to the sending ETH to a user controllable address. Someone could drain the whole contract of the ETH funds by exploiting this.


Remember, you have 4h to find as much as you can. Enjoy!
